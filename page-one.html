                        class="text-green">Dreams</span> to <span class="text-white-1">Reality</span></h4>
                <p class="text-center">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fascinated humanity for centuries, from ancient
                    myths to futuristic visions of sentient robots. The concept of machines emulating human intelligence
                    gained significant traction in the mid-20th century. Alan Turing, a brilliant British polymath,
                    pondered the possibility of machines solving problems and making decisions, laying the theoretical
                    foundation for AI.</p>
                <p class="text-center">However, the road to AI was far from smooth. In the 1950s, computers lacked the
                    ability to store commands, hindering progress. A breakthrough occurred in 1956 when the Logic
                    Theorist, developed by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon, showcased the potential of AI at
                    the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSRPAI). This event, although not
                    without challenges, ignited two decades of AI research.</p>

                <p class="text-center">From 1957 to 1974, AI flourished. Computers became faster and more accessible,
                    leading to innovations like Newell and Simon’s General Problem Solver and Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA,
                    demonstrating progress in problem-solving and language interpretation. However, the field faced a
                    major obstacle: computational power. Computers lacked the capacity to store vast information
                    necessary for tasks like language understanding. This limitation led to a decade-long slowdown in
                    research.</p>
                <p class="text-center">In the 1980s, AI experienced a resurgence. "Deep learning" techniques and expert
                    systems emerged, showcasing AI’s potential. Japan’s substantial investment in AI, particularly the
                    Fifth Generation Computer Project, provided crucial funding. Despite initial hype, many ambitious
                    goals were not met. Nevertheless, this era laid the groundwork for future AI innovations.</p>

                </h4>
                <p class="text-center">The 1990s and 2000s witnessed remarkable achievements. IBM's Deep Blue defeated
                    chess champion Gary Kasparov in 1997, marking a significant milestone in decision-making AI. Speech
                    recognition software and emotionally aware robots demonstrated AI’s diverse applications.
                    Technological advancements, coupled with Moore’s Law, which states that computer capabilities double
                    every year, enabled AI’s growth.</p>

                <p class="text-center">In the age of "big data," AI found new avenues. Massive computing power allowed
                    AI systems to learn from extensive datasets, revolutionising industries like technology, banking,
                    and marketing. Even as Moore's Law might be slowing, breakthroughs in computer science, mathematics,
                    and neuroscience provide hope for AI’s future.</p>

                <p class="text-center">AI's future holds exciting prospects. Conversational AI is already transforming
                    interactions, and driverless cars are becoming a reality. However, achieving general intelligence,
                    where machines surpass human cognitive abilities, remains a complex challenge. Ethical concerns also
                    loom large, necessitating thoughtful discussions on machine policy and ethics.</p>
                <p class="text-center">In conclusion, the history of AI reflects humanity's enduring quest for
                    innovation. From theoretical concepts to practical applications, AI has come a long way. As we stand
                    on the cusp of a new era in AI, embracing its potential while addressing ethical and societal
                    implications is paramount. The roller coaster journey of artificial intelligence continues,
                    promising a future where human ingenuity and AI innovations shape the world together.</p>
