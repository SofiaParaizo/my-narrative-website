                <p class="text-center project-text">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has fascinated humanity for centuries, from ancient myths to futuristic visions of sentient robots. The concept of machines emulating human intelligence gained significant traction in the mid-20th century. Alan Turing, a brilliant British polymath, pondered the possibility of machines solving problems and making decisions, laying the theoretical foundation for AI.</p>
                <p class="text-center project-text">However, the road to AI was far from smooth. In the 1950s, computers lacked the ability to store commands, hindering progress. A breakthrough occurred in 1956 when the Logic Theorist, developed by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon, showcased the potential of AI at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSRPAI). This event, although not without challenges, ignited two decades of AI research.</p>

                <p class="text-center project-text">From 1957 to 1974, AI flourished. Computers became faster and more accessible, leading to innovations like Newell and Simon’s General Problem Solver and Joseph Weizenbaum’s ELIZA, demonstrating progress in problem-solving and language interpretation. However, the field faced a major obstacle: computational power. Computers lacked the capacity to store vast information necessary for tasks like language understanding. This limitation led to a decade-long slowdown in research.</p>
                <p class="text-center project-text">In the 1980s, AI experienced a resurgence. "Deep learning" techniques and expert systems emerged, showcasing AI’s potential. Japan’s substantial investment in AI, particularly the Fifth Generation Computer Project, provided crucial funding. Despite initial hype, many ambitious goals were not met. Nevertheless, this era laid the groundwork for future AI innovations.</p>
