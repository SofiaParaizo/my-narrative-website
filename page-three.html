                            "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," where he introduced the concept of the Turing Test.
                            This test proposed a criterion to determine whether a machine's behaviour could exhibit
                            intelligent human-like responses.</p>

                        <p>The term "artificial intelligence" was officially coined in 1956 during the Dartmouth
                            Conference, organised by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester, and Claude
                            Shannon. This conference marked the birth of AI as a formal academic discipline, bringing
